## üí° Project Description

MockMe is a hilarious emotional chatbot that **mocks your feelings** instead of offering sympathy. Feeling down? It‚Äôs ready to roast you. Feeling proud? It‚Äôs ready to burst your bubble.

It‚Äôs the *emotional damage simulator* you didn‚Äôt know you needed.

## ü§î The Problem (That Doesn‚Äôt Exist)

Everyone builds apps to support your emotions. What about the art of *roasting*? Where‚Äôs the sass, the sarcasm, the savage therapy?

---

## üí• The Solution (Nobody Asked For)

We built a bot that listens to your emotions and replies with funny, sometimes rude responses ‚Äî all in good humor. It‚Äôs comedy therapy ‚Äî with zero filters.
